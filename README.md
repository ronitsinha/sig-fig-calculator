# Significant Figures Calculator

## Purpose
This program is intended to do three main 
things:
* Return the amount of sig figs of a given number
* Return a number with a given number of sig figs
* Evaluate expressions and return a result with the proper number of sig figs

## To-do list
* Complete the last two of the three main goals
* Possibly create a website for the calculator (would require everything to be rewritten in JS)
