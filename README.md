# Significant Figures Calculator

## Purpose
This program can currently do three main 
things:
* Return the amount of sig figs of a given number
* Set the amount of sig figs of a number (100 with 3 sig figs is 100.)
* Evaluate expressions and return a result with the proper number of sig figs

## To-do list
* Add support for constants/accepted values (numbers with infinite sigfigs, possible specify them with a 'C', i.e 1C has infinite sigfigs)
* Possibly create a website for the calculator (would require everything to be rewritten in JS)
